0x5yf3r.xyz is a person blog documenting my expanding cybersecurity knowledge and mapping it with a graph. 

## Why a graph you say?

Because all ontological data is best viewed through a graphs. 

Just as the networks in our brains are best mapped as graphs with neurotransmitter thresholds acting as a weighting mechanisms. The complexity of any semantic domain has interconnectedness that obscures it's potential for describing the unseen. Behind the black box behavior LLMs are known for houses this interconnectedness that human language and some say meaning can unfold from. 

So Graphs! and with their interconnectedness we will be able to see the unseen portions of a vast and fascination field. 

## Future growth

At some point I would like to represent the graph as a 4 dimensional object. Whereas one reads their way through the graph the graph itself unfolds. 

It would also be awesome to develop this page into a full educational platform. One where anyone can come and learn
